# Introduction to Computer Networking

## Typical Physical Components

* Endpoints
  * Include devices like printers, mobiles, etc which users use.
  * Used to retrieve or send data
* Interconnections
  * Components that connect the devices in network.
  * provide means for data to travel from one point to another
  * Include NICs which translates data provided by device to data that medium can understand
* Network Media
  * Provide means for signal to transfer from one device to another.
  * light, air, electricity
* Switches
  * Devices that endpoints connect to.
  * provide intelligent switching of data in LAN
* Rotuer
  * Intelligently choose the best path
  * main function is to route traffic from network to another
* Wireless Access point
  * Connected to a wide infrastructure so that traffic can be sent to physical server

## Topology

* Divided into
  * physical - arrangement of devices like cables, network devices and endpoints.
  * logical - path over which data is transferred.
